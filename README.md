# Project 2 Generative Audio

## Abstract

Continuing from an assignment I completed on this topic, I used Piano Genie to play out the digits of Pi. I put together a set of rules to use for this project. It used the first couple hundred digits of pi. I used the amount of digits enough for a 26 measure, one-minute song. They were grouped into sets of three as chords and held for a half note in 4/4 time. As Piano Genie only uses digits 1-8, a 9 denotes that that number be omitted and the chord was played for a whole note. If there was a 0 or a repeat number in the set of digits, they were played separately for a quarter note. After playing it on Piano Genie and letting the AI develop the composition, I plugged it into a composer software that allowed for tempo and a more structured sound, thus giving "Ï€ano Genie" its name.

## Model/Data

- Document outlining first thousand digits of pi grouped together via the given parameters
- Final Composition of Piano Genie piece

## Code

Your code for generating your project:
- Python: generative_code.py
- Jupyter notebooks: generative_code.ipynb

## Results

Documentation of your results in an appropriate format, both links to files and a brief description of their contents:
- `.wav` files or `.mp4`
- `.midi` files
- musical scores
- ... some other form

## Technical Notes

Any implementation details or notes we need to repeat your work. 
- Does this code require other pip packages, software, etc?
- Does it run on some other (non-datahub) platform? (CoLab, etc.)
