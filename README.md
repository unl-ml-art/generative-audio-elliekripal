# Project 2 Generative Audio

Ellie Kripal, ekripal2@unl.edu

## Abstract

Continuing from an assignment I completed on this topic, I used Piano Genie to play out the digits of Pi. I put together a set of rules to use for this project. It used the first couple hundred digits of pi. I used the amount of digits enough for a 26 measure, one-minute song. They were grouped into sets of three as chords and held for a quarter note in 4/4 time. As Piano Genie only uses digits 1-8, a 9 denotes that that number be omitted and the chord was played for a half note. If there was a 0 or a repeat number in the set of digits, they were played separately for an eighth note and sixteenth note respectively. After playing it on Piano Genie and letting the AI develop the composition, I plugged it into a composer software that allowed for tempo and a more structured sound, thus giving "πano Genie" its name.
